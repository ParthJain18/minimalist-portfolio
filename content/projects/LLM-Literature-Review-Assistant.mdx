# LLM Literature Review Assistant

## Project Overview

The **LLM Literature Review Assistant** is a comprehensive set of Python notebooks designed to **semi-automate the initial screening phase** of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) and general research paper discovery. This tool leverages Large Language Models to streamline the traditionally time-intensive process of academic literature review.

## Problem Statement

Academic researchers face significant challenges when conducting literature reviews:
- **Information Overload**: Thousands of potentially relevant papers across multiple databases
- **Time-Intensive Screening**: Manual evaluation of abstracts and full texts
- **Consistency Issues**: Maintaining consistent evaluation criteria across large datasets
- **Bias in Selection**: Human cognitive biases affecting paper selection
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited time and human resources for comprehensive reviews

## Solution Architecture

### Automated Screening Pipeline
The assistant implements a multi-stage screening process that mirrors traditional SLR methodology while leveraging AI capabilities:

1. **Paper Collection**: Automated retrieval from academic databases
2. **Initial Filtering**: LLM-based relevance screening using inclusion/exclusion criteria
3. **Abstract Analysis**: Detailed analysis of abstracts for research focus alignment
4. **Quality Assessment**: Preliminary quality evaluation using established metrics
5. **Categorization**: Automatic categorization by research themes and methodologies
