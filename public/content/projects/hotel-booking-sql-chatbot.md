# Hotel Booking SQL + RAG Chatbot

An intelligent conversational interface that revolutionizes hotel booking data queries through natural language processing and automated SQL generation.

## Project Overview

This advanced chatbot system bridges the gap between natural language and database queries, allowing users to interact with hotel booking data using everyday language. The system combines SQL generation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

### Core Components
- **Python Backend**: Robust server implementation
- **LangGraph Framework**: Advanced agent orchestration and workflow management
- **FastAPI**: High-performance API with automatic documentation
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient local database with sample hotel booking data

### AI/ML Pipeline
- **Large Language Models**: State-of-the-art models for natural language understanding
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic representation of queries and database schema
- **Retrieval System**: Intelligent context retrieval for enhanced responses

## Database Schema

### Tables Structure
```sql
-- Hotels table
Hotels: id, name, location, rating, price_range, amenities

-- Bookings table  
Bookings: id, hotel_id, guest_name, check_in, check_out, room_type, status

-- Guests table
Guests: id, name, email, phone, loyalty_status

-- Rooms table
Rooms: id, hotel_id, room_number, room_type, price_per_night, occupancy
```

### Sample Queries Supported
- "Which hotels have the highest ratings in Mumbai?"
- "Show me all cancelled bookings for last month"
- "What's the average booking duration for luxury hotels?"
- "Find available rooms for weekend getaway under ‚Çπ5000"

## Implementation Details

### Natural Language Processing
1. **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the type of query (search, filter, aggregate)
2. **Entity Extraction**: Extracts relevant entities (dates, locations, prices)
3. **Schema Mapping**: Maps natural language terms to database columns
4. **SQL Generation**: Constructs optimized SQL queries

### RAG Enhancement Process
1. **Context Retrieval**: Fetches relevant historical context
2. **Result Enrichment**: Adds explanatory information to raw results
3. **Insight Generation**: Provides analytical insights and recommendations
4. **Response Formatting**: Presents information in user-friendly format

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Ambiguous Query Interpretation
**Problem**: Natural language queries can be ambiguous or incomplete
**Solution**: Implemented clarification dialogue system and context-aware interpretation

### Challenge 2: Complex SQL Generation
**Problem**: Generating accurate SQL for complex multi-table queries
**Solution**: Created modular SQL generation with validation and optimization layers

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Maintaining fast response times for complex database operations
**Solution**: Implemented query caching, indexing strategies, and connection pooling

## Advanced Features

### Query Types Supported
- **Simple Filters**: Basic WHERE clause conditions
- **Date Ranges**: Flexible date parsing and filtering
- **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX operations
- **Joins**: Multi-table relationships and complex joins
- **Subqueries**: Nested query support for complex scenarios

### Business Intelligence Features
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies booking patterns and trends
- **Revenue Analytics**: Revenue calculations and projections
- **Occupancy Reports**: Room occupancy statistics and insights
- **Customer Segmentation**: Guest behavior analysis

## User Experience

### Conversation Flow
